## Abstract

This document presents the High-Level Design (HLD) for a full-stack authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) system built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The system implements industry-standard security practices including JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and a comprehensive role-based authorization mechanism. It provides a secure foundation for user authentication, session management, and access control that can be integrated into various web applications. The design addresses critical security challenges while maintaining flexibility, scalability, and a positive user experience.

## General Description

### Product Perspective

The MERN Authentication System is designed as a modular, reusable component that can be integrated into any MERN stack application requiring user authentication and role-based access control. It functions as the security foundation upon which application-specific features can be built, providing standardized mechanisms for managing user identity and access permissions.

### Problem Statement

Web applications require robust security mechanisms to:
- Verify user identities securely
- Protect sensitive user data
- Control access to resources based on user permissions
- Maintain state across sessions in a secure manner
- Prevent common security vulnerabilities

Implementing these mechanisms from scratch is time-consuming and error-prone, often leading to security vulnerabilities when not properly executed.

### Proposed Solution

Our authentication system addresses these challenges through:

#### Client-side (React.js):
- Form components for registration and login
- Protected route mechanism restricting access to authenticated users
- Role-based component rendering based on user permissions
- Global authentication state management
- JWT storage and management
- Interceptors for authenticated API requests

#### Server-side (Node.js/Express.js):
- RESTful API endpoints for authentication operations
- Secure password handling with bcrypt
- JWT generation and validation
- MongoDB integration for user data storage
- Middleware for authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control for API endpoints

### Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:
- Multi-factor authentication
- Social login integration (OAuth)
- Advanced password policies
- Session management improvements
- Administrative dashboard for user management
- Enhanced audit logging
- Real-time notification system

### Technical Requirements

## System Architecture

### Client Architecture

The client-side architecture follows a component-based approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Layers:
- Presentation Layer: React components for UI rendering
- State Management Layer: Authentication context/store
- Service Layer: API integration, token management
- Routing Layer: Protected and public routes

#### Key Components:
- Auth Context: Global state provider for authentication status and user data
- Auth Service: Handles API calls related to authentication
- Protected Route Component: Higher-order component to restrict access
- Auth Forms: Registration, login, password reset components
- Token Service: Manages JWT storage, retrieval, and expiration
- API Client: Configures Axios with authentication headers

#### State Management:
The authentication state is managed globally using React Context API or Redux, maintaining:
- User information (profile, roles)
- Authentication status
- JWT token
- Loading states
- Error messages

### Server Architecture

The server architecture follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern with Express.js:

#### Core Layers:
- Routes Layer: API endpoint definitions
- Controller Layer: Request handling logic
- Service Layer: Business logic implementation
- Model Layer: Data models and database interactions
- Middleware Layer: Authentication, authorization, validation

#### Key Components:
- Auth Routes: Express router defining authentication endpoints

## Process Flows

### Authentication Flow

#### Registration Flow:
- User fills registration form
- Client validates inputs
- Client sends POST to /api/auth/register
- Server validates request data
- Server checks for existing user
- Server hashes password with bcrypt
- Server creates new user in database
- Server generates verification token (optional)
- Server sends verification email (optional)
- Server responds with success message
- Client redirects to login page or verification notice

#### Login Flow:
- User fills login form
- Client validates inputs
- Client sends POST to /api/auth/login
- Server validates request data
- Server locates user by email/username
- Server compares password with stored hash
- Server generates JWT containing user ID and roles
- Server responds with JWT and user data
- Client stores JWT in secure storage
- Client updates auth context with user data
- Client redirects to protected area

#### Authentication Verification Flow:
- Client attempts to access protected route/resource
- Client checks for valid JWT in storage
- If absent, redirects to login
- If present, includes JWT in Authorization header
- Server middleware verifies JWT signature and expiration
- Server extracts user ID and roles from JWT
- Server attaches user context to request
- If verification fails, server returns 401 error
- Client handles 401 by clearing invalid token and redirecting to login

### Authorization Flow

#### Role-Based Access Control Flow:
- Client attempts to access protected component/route with role requirement
- Client checks user roles from auth context
- If sufficient permissions, render component/route
- If insufficient permissions, render unauthorized notice or redirect
- For API calls, client sends request with JWT
- Server verifies JWT via auth middleware
- Server extracts roles from JWT
- Role middleware checks if required role exists in user roles
- If authorized, request proceeds to controller
- If unauthorized, server returns 403 Forbidden response

### Error Handling

#### Authentication Errors:
- Invalid credentials: Clear error messages without revealing specifics
- Expired tokens: Automatic redirect to login
- Invalid tokens: Removal from storage and redirect to login

#### Authorization Errors:
- Insufficient permissions: User-friendly explanation
- Expired sessions: Graceful handling with clear messaging

#### Server Errors:
- Centralized error handling middleware
- Appropriate status codes (401, 403, 500, etc.)
- Structured error responses
